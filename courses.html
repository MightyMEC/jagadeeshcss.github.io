    <h3>html</h3>
    <p>Front-end technologies provide the goal of attracting any type of software infrastructure. Back-end technologies might give smooth interaction with data, but if the view of the application or website does not attract users would hardly look twice at any websites, if there is no visual attraction to draw them in.  

        As per the research, within the next decade i.e., from 2019 to 2029, the growth for front-end developers is going to be huge in numbers. Keeping this in mind, one should pay attention to the front end technologies list in Java and front end technologies list in .net as well as the common front end web technologies list that can add success to one’s life in the software field. Some of the Best Front End Development Course can be found in the attached link. Also, here you will find the front end technologies list to watch out, these are the best front end technologies</p>

        <h3>css</h3>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

            CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
            
            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
            
            The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
            
            The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.
            
            In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is also used in the GTK widget toolkit.</p>
    <h3>javascript</h3>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a compact, object-based computer programming language for developing client and server internet applications.

We commonly use JavaScript language in web development to create interactive effects within the web browser. Brendan Eich of Netscape originally developed JavaScript language.

JavaScript is an open source, script-based programming language where the source code is processed by the client’s web browser rather than on the web server.

Here, we have designed the complete JavaScript syllabus for comprehensive study. This syllabus contains full industrial JavaScript topics to learn the JavaScript from basic to advanced.

IT professionals, freshers, and engineering students from Computer science/Information Technology professional degrees can learn complete JavaScript scripting language based on industry syllabus.

Professionals from the IT industry who are currently working in other programming languages and want to switch over JavaScript can use this syllabus to enhance their knowledge of JavaScript.

            <h3>core java</h3>
            <p>Java is a versatile, high-level, object-oriented programming language that has been widely used for over two decades. Here are some key theoretical concepts and principles associated with Java <br>
        
                1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:<br>
                   -Java is a pure object-oriented programming language, meaning everything in Java is an object or belongs to a class.<br>
                
                2. **Platform Independence**:<br>
                   - Java is platform-independent because it compiles code into bytecode, which can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).<br>
                
                3. **The Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**:<br>
                   - The JVM is responsible for executing Java bytecode. It provides a runtime environment that handles memory management and execution of Java programs.<br>
                
                4. **Syntax and Structure**:<br>
                   - Java has a C-like syntax with a clear and consistent structure, including classes, methods, and packages.<br>
                
                5. **Data Types**:<br>
                   - Java supports various data types, including primitive data types (int, float, char) and reference data types (objects).<br>
                
                6. **Classes and Objects**:<br>
                   - In Java, everything is encapsulated within classes, and objects are instances of classes.<br>
                
                7. **Inheritance**:<br>
                   - Java supports class inheritance, allowing one class to inherit attributes and methods from another.<br>
                
                8. **Polymorphism**:<br>
                   - Java allows polymorphism, which means objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass.<br>
                
                9. **Encapsulation**:<br>
                   - Java uses access modifiers (public, private, protected) to encapsulate data and control access to it.<br>
                
                10. **Abstraction**:<br>
                    - Abstraction involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on their essential properties and behaviors.<br>
                
                11. **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**:<br>
                    - Java supports interfaces, which define a contract that implementing classes must adhere to. Abstract classes provide a blueprint for other classes and can contain both abstract and concrete methods.<br>
                
                12. **Exception Handling**:<br>
                    - Java has a robust exception handling mechanism to catch and handle runtime errors, which helps prevent program crashes.<br>
                
                13. **Multithreading**:<br>
                    - Java provides built-in support for multithreading, enabling the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a program.<br>
                
                14. **Garbage Collection**:<br>
                    - Java's automatic memory management system deallocates memory that is no longer in use, helping to prevent memory leaks.<br>
                
                15. **Collections Framework**:<br>
                    - Java offers a rich set of classes and interfaces for handling collections of objects, such as lists, sets, and maps.<br>
                
                16. **File I/O**:<br>
                    - Java provides a comprehensive library for file input and output, allowing you to read and write files.<br>
                
                17. **Networking**:<br>
                    - Java's networking capabilities allow for the development of networked applications, including client-server communication.<br>
                
                18. **Security**:<br>
                    - Java has built-in security features, such as the Java Security Manager, to protect against malicious code.<br>
                
                19. **Applets**:<br>
                    - Java applets are small programs that can run in a web browser. While they have become less common, they were once used for web-based interactivity.<br>
                
                20. **Development Tools**:<br>
                    - Java is typically developed using Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans.<br>
                
                21. **Standard Library**:<br>
                    - Java's extensive standard library provides pre-built classes and methods for common tasks like data manipulation, input/output, and data structures.<br>
                
                Understanding these theoretical concepts is crucial for becoming proficient in Java programming. Java is known for its portability, ease of use, and strong community support, making it a popular choice for web, mobile, desktop, and enterprise application development.</p>

                    5. **Data Types**:<br>
                       - Python supports various data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.<br>
                    
                    6. **Variables and Data Structures**:<br>
                       - Python provides a rich set of built-in data structures, including lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets. These structures can be used to store and manipulate data efficiently.<br>
                    
                    7. **Functions and Modules**:<br>
                       - Functions in Python allow you to encapsulate a set of instructions into a reusable block of code. Modules enable you to organize functions and variables into separate files for better code organization.<br>
                    
                    8. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:<br>
                       - Python supports OOP principles, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.<br>
                    
                    9. **Exception Handling**:<br>

                    <h3>SQL</h3>
                    <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is the standard language for interacting with databases, and it plays a crucial role in data management and retrieval. Here are some key theoretical concepts and principles associated with SQL <br>
                
                        1. **Relational Databases**:<br>
                           - SQL is designed for use with relational database management systems (RDBMS), such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.<br>
                        
                        2. **Data Model**:<br>
                           - SQL is based on the relational data model, which represents data as tables (relations) with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).<br>
                        
                        3. **Tables**:<br>
                           - Tables are the fundamental structure in SQL. They store data in rows and columns. Each table represents a particular entity or concept.<br>
                        
                        4. **Data Types**:<br>
                           - SQL supports various data types, including integers, floats, strings, dates, and custom data types.<br>
                        
                        5. **CRUD Operations**:<br>
                           - SQL provides four fundamental operations: Create (INSERT), Read (SELECT), Update (UPDATE), and Delete (DELETE). These operations allow you to manipulate data within tables.<br>
                        
                        6. **SQL Statements**:<br>
                           - SQL consists of various statements, including SELECT (for querying data), INSERT (for adding data), UPDATE (for modifying data), DELETE (for removing data), and others like CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, and DROP TABLE.<br>
                        
                        7. **Queries**:<br>
                           - SQL queries are used to retrieve specific data from a database. The SELECT statement is commonly used to build queries.<br>
                        
                        8. **Filtering and Sorting**:<br>
                           - SQL allows you to filter and sort data using the WHERE clause for conditions and the ORDER BY clause for sorting.<br>
                        
                        9. **Joins**:<br>
                           - SQL supports different types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN) to combine data from multiple tables based on a related column.<br>
                        
                        10. **Aggregation**:<br>
                            - SQL provides aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN) for summarizing and analyzing data.<br>
                        
                        11. **Grouping**:<br>
                            - The GROUP BY clause is used to group data into subsets for performing aggregate functions on those subsets.<br>
                        
                        12. **Indexes**:<br>
                            - Indexes are used to improve query performance by allowing the database system to locate data quickly.<br>
                        
                        13. **Transactions**:<br>
                            - SQL supports transactions, which are sequences of one or more SQL statements that are treated as a single unit of work. Transactions ensure data integrity and consistency.<br>
                        
                        14. **Normalization**:<br>
                            - Database normalization is a process of organizing data in a database to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves creating tables with appropriate relationships.<br>
                        
                        15. **Data Constraints**:<br>
                            - SQL enables the use of constraints (e.g., PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL) to enforce data integrity rules.<br>
                        
                        16. **Views**:<br>
                            - Views are virtual tables generated from the result of a SQL query. They provide a way to simplify complex queries and control data access.<br>
                        
                        17. **Stored Procedures and Functions**:<br>
                            - SQL allows the creation of stored procedures and functions, which are sets of SQL statements that can be executed by calling the procedure or function.<br>
                        
                        18. **Security**:<br>
                            - SQL databases provide security features to control access to data, such as user roles and permissions.<br>
                        
                        19. **Data Definition Language (DDL)**:<br>
                            - DDL statements are used to define and manage the structure of the database, including creating tables, altering their structure, and deleting tables.<br>
                        
                        20. **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**:<br>
                            - DML statements are used to manipulate data in the database, including inserting, updating, and deleting records.<br>
                        
                        Understanding these theoretical concepts is fundamental for working with SQL and relational databases effectively. SQL is a critical skill for data professionals, software developers, and anyone involved in data management and analysis.</p>
